    documentation="An Enterprise Architecture (EA) translates business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating and improving the essential requirements, principles, drivers, and models that describe the enterprise’s future state and enable its evolution. The EA establishes the organization-wide roadmap to achieve the mission through optimal performance of its core business functions within an efficient information technology (IT) environment. Enterprise architectures are blueprints; they define the organization’s current (baseline) and desired (target) settings, and specify the mechanisms to transform the enterprise to achieve target outcomes systematically"/>
